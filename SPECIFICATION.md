## Specification

### Overview

Follower-Maze is a **client-server application** built for social networking.
Users follow other users, post messages, send private messages, unfollow users, and so on.
* Each of these actions is an _event_, created by an _event-source_ and sent to the _server_.
* Each event is processed by the _server_.
* The processing of the event may have follow-on effects on other _user-clients_.

The **server** listens for two kinds of **clients**:
* **1 event source**, which emits events.
* **N user-clients** that connect to the server.

### Client/Server Protocol

* The protocol is line-based i.e. a LF control character terminates each message.
All strings are encoded in UTF-8.
* Data is transmitted over TCP sockets.
* The _event source_ connects on port 9090 and will start sending events as soon as the connection is accepted.
* The _user clients_ connect on port 9099 and identify themselves with their user ID.
For example, once connected a _user client_ may send down `2932\r\n`,
indicating that it is representing user 2932.
* After the identification is sent,
the user client starts waiting for events to be sent to them by the server.

### Events

There are five possible events.
The table below describes payloads sent by the event source and what each represents:

```
| Payload       | Sequence # | Type          | From User Id | To User Id |
|---------------|------------|---------------|--------------|------------|
| 666|F|60|50   | 666        | Follow        | 60           | 50         |
| 1|U|12|9      | 1          | Unfollow      | 12           | 9          |
| 542532|B      | 542532     | Broadcast     | -            | -          |
| 43|P|32|56    | 43         | Private Msg   | 32           | 56         |
| 634|S|32      | 634        | Status Update | 32           | -          |
```

### Event Rules

* Each message begins with a sequence number.
* However, the event source _does not send events in any given order_.
In particular, sequence number has no effect on the order in which events are sent.
* Events _may_ generate notifications for _user clients_.
If there is a respective target _user client_ connected,
the notification is routed according to the following rules:
  * Follow: Only the `To User Id` is notified
    * A follow event from user A to user B means that user A now follows user B.
  * Unfollow: No clients are notified
    * An unfollow event from user A to user B means that user A stopped following user B.
  * Broadcast: All connected _user clients_ are notified
  * Private Message: Only the `To User Id` is notified
  * Status Update: All current followers of the `From User ID` are notified
* If there are no _user clients_ connected for a user,
any notifications for them are currently ignored.
_User clients_ are notified of events _in the correct sequence-number order_,
regardless of the order in which the _event source_ sent them.

### The Problem

The specification of the problem leaves the question of bad event data unanswered,
and it simplifies the case of undeliverable notifications in case of user disconnects.
Your task is to **add a [Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_letter_queue)
to the server**, so that undeliverable or malformed messages aren't lost.

“Dead letters” build up and ultimately must be dealt with.
For the purposes of this interview problem, it's OK to simply log them to the console.
But please **include a short explanation in your README** of how you would store and process
that data in a production scenario.
